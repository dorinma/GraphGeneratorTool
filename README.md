# GraphGeneratorTool
This tool made for generating different kinds of graphs by returning 3 kind of files. 

The first file is gr, represent the edges. each row is a edge - 2 vertices, with differnt weight. 

This tool give the option to insert more than one objective, each represent a differnet "price" of the edge like distance or time. 

Each objective need the min value and the max value so the objective be like real data and each of them will written to a differnt ge file.
